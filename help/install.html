<h1>Install Guide</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>You need to have tf5.0b8 with the tf-python patch to use these scripts. You
can get TinyFugue from
<a href="http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net">http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net</a>
and you can get the tf-python patch from
<a href="http://sizer99.com/tf/">http://sizer99.com/tf/</a>. You will also need
Python 2.5 or later installed on your system. Compiling tf will require access
to the libraries.</p>

<p>On my system I installed the python2.6-dev package from Ubuntu's repository
and linked to it with the following configure command:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-libdirs=/usr/lib/python2.6
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>After configuring completed I followed up with:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
make
make install
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Getting the Source</h2>

<p>You need an up-to-date version of the Zombii archive which you can get with
the following <em>git</em> command:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/schrepfer/zombii.git
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Setting up TF</h2>

<p>To setup tf run the script called <em>install.sh</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
./zombii/install.sh
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer the questions as you are prompted. If you do not wish to save your
password inside of the .tfrc go ahead and hit enter while it asks you for your
password.</p>

<p>By default tf installs executables to your <em>$HOME/bin</em> directory.
Make sure you have that added to your <em>$PATH</em> variable.</p>

<h2>Starting</h2>

<p>To start up tf it's as simple as typing the name of your world. By default
the worlds are of the format <em>zombie-[character]</em>. If you chose to have
the symlink created, you can simply type the name of your world:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
zombie-conglomo
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you opted out of having the symlink created you can load up tf by
typing:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
tf
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you use the symlink option, tf is started inside of gnu screen. That will
allow you to have your account always connected to the mud. All you have to do
is type the name of your world and it'll restore your previous session. If a
previous session does not exist a new one will be created.</p>
